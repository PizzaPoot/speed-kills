## Game Description draft

**SPEED KILLS** — Like a wise man once said “Speed has never killed anyone. Suddenly becoming stationary, that's what gets you.” Your job is to **NEVER STOP** but that might get difficult with hordes of enemies getting in your way. So put your foot on the floor, gather speed and **BLAST** through them.

Made in a few days as a laid-back gamejam with friends
